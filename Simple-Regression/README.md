# Simple Regression

Regression is an important tool in data analysis. We try to make user
understand the relations of 1) fitted regression line and residual plot,
2) fiited regression line and residual sum of squares. When the custom
line getting closer to the fitted one, residuals would be more spread out
and the RSS would be minimized to the lowest point.
