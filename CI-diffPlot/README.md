# Confidence Interval misconception:
This one is a improved version of Confidence Interval in my Shiny apps repository.
It is compute by diffPlot function in gplot package. It is much simpler than the previous
one, and the dotted lines help user see that CI of group means depart from the mean
of group 1.
