# Teaching statistics with Shiny apps

We use R package, shiny, to build web application and create interactive graphics to demonstrate statistical concept for students in psychology. Statistical analysis is an important part in educating a psychology student. However, many people still need many effort to understand the materials provided in traditional textbook. We believe the interactive graphics help people to better understand the concept of statistics. 

We design 5 shiny apps, which can be divided into two parts: 1) teaching statistical concepts, e.g. confidence interval and the significance of a t-test, the optimization of simple regression, and the parameters in the model of signal detection theory; and, 2) understanding statistical misconception throught interactive visualization, e.g. small sample size bias and ecological fallacy. We make the control panel with least options, which would help user concentrate on the crucial part of our apps. Please enjoy our shiny interactive graphics.
