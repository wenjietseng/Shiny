# Shiny apps
Use R package--shiny to create interactive graphics
Interactive graphics help people visualize data. Moreover, the "interactive" could be a tool for illustrating statistical concepts. We produce 3 shiny apps for teaching confidence interval, simple regression, and signal detection theory. The other 3 shiny apps are for statistical misconceptions, one may use our application and know the key idea of those fallacies. We make the control panel with least options, which would help user concentrate on the crucial part of our apps. Please enjoy our shiny interactive graphics.
